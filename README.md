# A GREAT TIME-SAVER
So many factors affect our energy consumption needs that estimating the necessary calorie intake in mind would be too complicated. You end up wasting half of your day doing lots of math with your calories, weight, and height and comparing your target body mass to your current weight.

No one wants to spend their life on endless calculations! Let your visitors delegate that tedious work to our WordPress Calorie Calculator plugin. Install it and make your website attract even more sports and weight management strivers.

# SCIENCE BEHIND THE CALORIES
BMR, or basal metabolic rate, is one of the most widely used parameters for defining the preferred calorie ratio. For our calculator plugin, we use the Mifflin—St. Jeor formula. It identifies BMR by analyzing the essential features of your organism: body mass, height, age, and biological sex. The plugin calculates daily calorie consumption rate using those numbers with the multipliers needed to account for the goals and conditions. The formula also takes sports and other types of activity into account: this way, the users can be sure that the calorie norm offered by WP Calorie Calculator corresponds with their individual physical characteristics such as weight, height, and others.

# HOW IT WORKS

Among those, there are lifestyle for which users tick the one that fits them best and body mass goals with the dropdown menu offering weight maintenance, loss, or gain (and the pace of the process).
